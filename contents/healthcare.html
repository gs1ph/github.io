									<p>The Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) provides a unique identification solution for healthcare items as when linked with the item’s batch number and expiration date, it helps provide traceability from production to patient delivery.</p>

									<p>Pharmaceutical sectors will be able to keep track of the different medicinal products they have, along with additional details such as: Batch number, expiry date, and the dosage amount. Staff and personnel can also now be traced based on which specific patients they attended to, and vice versa. It is also possible to track down what kinds of treatment and medical equipment were used on any given patient in time.</p>
									
									<p>GS1 standards also allows healthcare sectors to provide improved services towards their patients at a lower risk to their costs in time and resources, and to the patient's health. This leads to an overall improved safety of care as caregivers and other clinical staff will have a more efficient time tending to patients, along with better resource optimization when it comes to managing time and inventory.</p>
									
									<p>GS1 standards provide a wide assortment of benefits and opportunities for the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors – for the staff and personnel in charge, and for the consumers and patients themselves.</p>
