									<p>Whether it is defence, engineering, construction, mass transit or mining: All these technical industries are facing many of the same challenges: From the pressures of cost, counterfeiting and the race to digitize their physical worlds. </p>

									<p>These industries all share a mutual need for transparent processes to optimize their supply chains as parts and raw materials enter production environments and are processed, assembled and packaged; have their life cycle managed with parts exiting as finished products, and remain in operation for many decades. </p>
									
									<p>Technical industries must also safeguard themselves against any cases of counterfeiting that risk infiltrating and endangering their factories, maintenance and repair operations (MRO), and aftermarket sales which can affect them and their consumers. </p>
									
									<p>Lastly as their digital factories evolve, technical industries must reduce the complexity of their intralogistics processes and connect them in standardized ways in order to drive interoperability. Achieving interoperability has become a mandatory process for profitable operations, and a requirement for that is GS1 standards that can be used to uniquely identify individual parts, products and shipments for real-time monitoring along the supply chain, in aftermarket sales and services, and the life cycle management. </p>

									<p>By encoding a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) into a GS1 barcode on a partâ€™s label or an EPC/RFID tag, trading partners will be able to verify the authenticity of the part and exchange data in real-time on its attributes, performance and MRO activities. Furthermore, the GS1 Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) is used to identify the logistics unit along with its individual parts, and provides the suppliers and manufacturers with the ability to track shipment, in each and every step of the way.  </p>

									<p>By using GS1 standards to drive interoperability within technical industries and sectors, there will be a lead towards greater efficiency and lower costs.</p>
