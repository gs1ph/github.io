									<p>In today’s information-based age where more and more people are becoming more curious, and want to be more well-informed and assured about their purchases or what goes on within the supply chain: It has led to the rise and implementation of a system that would enable one to keep track of what goes on regarding the products they purchase or consume. And that system is traceability. </p>

									<p>Traceability is defined as the ability to trace the history, application or location of an object. In consideration of a product or a service; traceability relates to the origin of a product’s raw materials or parts, its processing history, distribution and location of the product or service after delivery. With GS1 global standards, a system of traceability is established and firmly in place that makes this possible. </p>
									
									<p>GS1 has developed Identification Keys to identify products during each and every aspect of the supply chain process such as: </p>
									
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) that covers tradeable products </li>
                                        <li>The Global Location Number (GLN) that covers locations where your product may have passed like distribution/manufacturing channels </li>
                                        <li>And the Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) which identifies the logistic units involved in the entire procedure. </li>
                                    </ul>

									<p>Together with its unique identification number, serial numbers can also be assigned to allow everyone involved in the process to keep track of every relevant detail that needs to be known about a product. All this information is stored within a large unified data network that keeps track of the product’s identification numbers and all information relating to it. 
                                        Traceability plays a major part in allowing stakeholders or anyone part of the supply chain to be more well-informed but more importantly, feel a degree of safety and assurance of the product they are getting, and the full details behind said products. 
                                        </p>
