                                        The GS1 Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN) is an Internet-based, interconnected network, built around the GS1 Global Registry®, GDSN-certified data pools, the <a href="#0">GS1 Data Quality Framework</a> and <a href="#0">GS1 Global Product Classification (GPC)</a>. It enables companies around the world to exchange standardised and synchronized supply chain data with their trading partners.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        The GS1 Global Registry is the GDSN’s “network facilitator and information directory” that guarantees the uniqueness of the registered items and parties. It provides data pools critical information to establish data synchronization communications in the network and ensures they are using a standard set of messages, validation rules, and processes.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        GDSN-certified Data Pools are electronic catalogues of standardized item data. They serve as a source and/or a recipient of master data. Data Pools can be run by a GS1 Member Organization or by a solution provider.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        GDSN calls for data quality programmes that are sustainable and focused on the long term: experience has shown time and again that business benefits come not from enacting short-term curative data cleansing actions, but only from having good quality data from the start. To help ensure this level of data quality, GDSN recommends the processes described in the GS1 Data Quality Framework. The GS1 Data Quality Framework uses GS1 standards and fits perfectly into GDSN. For suppliers, it enhances internal processes and guarantees the good quality of data that is shared. For retailers, hospitals, pharmacies and other data recipients, it helps ensure that they have the means to receive and use proper information.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        To ensure products are classified correctly and uniformly, GDSN uses <a href="#0">GS1 Global Product Classification (GPC)</a>, a system that gives buyers and sellers a common language for grouping products in the same way everywhere in the world. This improves the Global Data Synchronization Network’s data accuracy and integrity, speeds up the supply chain’s ability to react to consumer needs and contributes to breaking down language barriers. It also facilitates the reporting process across product silos. The foundation of GPC is called a “brick”. GPC bricks define categories of similar products. Using the GPC brick as part of GDSN ensures the correct recognition of the product category across the extended supply chain, from seller to buyer.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        With GDSN, business partners always have the latest information in their systems, and any changes made to one company’s database are automatically and immediately provided to all of the other companies who do business with them. When a supplier and a customer know they are looking at the same accurate and up-to-date data, it is smoother, quicker and less expensive for them to do business together. The GDSN provides a single point of truth for product information. Synchronizing accurate, properly classified data also results in improved accuracy of orders, fewer forms to fill out, fewer duplicate systems and processes, and, most importantly, a proven way to drive unnecessary costs out of the supply chain.
                    
                                    </p>
