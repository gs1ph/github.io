                                        Radio Frequency Identification is a technology which enables data to be transmitted, via radio waves, across an air interface, in compliance with a set of locally or globally agreed laws and standards. It is an established data-carrying technology, used throughout industry in various formats for decades but it is not the ‘solution to all problems‘. It is merely a 'tool’ to enhance accuracy, efficiency and information provision, within or between organizations.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        The data contained is often merely a unique ID relating to the item/object and is stored on a tag which is attached to the item/object.  A tag on entering a radio field operating at the same frequency, is activated by the energy of the radio waves emitted from the reader creating the field.  On activation, the RFID tag sends data relating to the item, stored in its memory, back to reader via radio waves.

                                        The RFID tag enables the chip to receive and respond to radio-frequency  queries from an RFID transceiver. There are three types of RFID tags, namely:
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Active Tags are equipped with a battery that can be used as a partial or complete source of power for the tag's circuitry and antenna. They can initiate activity or response. They can be read at distances of one hundred feet or more. They may have other sensors that can use electricity for power. They can be turned off.
                                        </li>
                    
                                        <li>
                                            Passive RFID tags rely entirely on the reader as their power source. They are only capable to respond. These tags are read at short range (up to six meters away).They have lower production costs and thus less expensive.
                                        </li>
                    
                                        <li>
                                            Semi-passive tags operate similarly to passive RFID tags. However, they contain a battery that enables longer reading distance and also enables the tag to operate independently of the reader. It is important to understand that the communication in semi-passive tags is still completely passive; no power is transmitted – the tag simply reflects back some of the power emitted by the RFID reader.
                                        </li>
                    
                                    </ul>
                                    
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        There are three storage types of RFID tags that affect its price, namely: read-write, read-only and WORM (write once, read many). A read-write tag's data can be added to or overwritten. Read-only tags cannot be added to or overwritten -- they contain only the data that is stored in them when they were made. WORM tags can have additional data (like another serial number) added once, but they cannot be overwritten.
