	  							<h2>GS1 on Retail</h2>
	  						</div>
							<div class="clearfix text-formatted">
								<div>
									<p>Back in the year 1973, the retail industry came together in order to select a single standard for product identification — the barcode. What initially started as a way to speed grocery store checkout has now become the global language of business — transforming the way we work and live even to this very day. </p>
									<p>In today’s omni-channel commerce world, GS1 standards are used to identify, capture and share information about products – both in stores and online – so that retailers can fully leverage well-established distribution networks, reduce store markdown costs, enhance customer experiences, increase sales, and build trust in their brands by providing accurate, up-to-date information that is provided by a trusted data foundation.</p>

								<h2>GS1 Standards in Retail</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="clearfix text-formatted">
								<div>
									<p>GS1 is able to help retail industries bridge this gap between the physical and digital, while also ensuring that retail industries are still able to meet the expectations of their consumers. </p>
									<p>The Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) and the Global Location Number (GLN) are used in order to give trade items such as food or consumer goods, and locations respectively their own unique identifiers within the supply chain to distinguish them from others, creating a system of traceability </p>
									<p>The traceability system ensures that all parts of the supply chain process are easily tracked down the history, application and location of a product from its point of origin, to where it has passed, up to its end destination. </p>

								<h2>Trends and Consumer Behavior</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="clearfix text-formatted">
								<div>
									<p>Trends and consumer behavior are changing and what was once considered the "norm" is now being slowly pushed out in favor of methods and behaviors that reflect our current online and information-laden age. Consumers' habits have changed to alternating between shopping in-store, and shopping at online e-commerce channels but overall, expect the same consistent shopping experience. </p>
									<p>Retail industries are now developing the bridge between their physical and digital commerce in order to avoid segregating them from one another, and to make them both one in the same experience for the consumer. Their focus has shifted to creating "personal supply chains" for food, clothing, electronics and more. </p>
								</div>

								<h2>Digitalization and Standardization </h2>
							</div>
							<div class="clearfix text-formatted">
								<div>
									<p>GS1’s history in retail is a long one – with the ubiquitous “beep” of the GS1 barcode being heard at store checkouts all around the world, over 6 billion times every day. In the wake of the growing digital age, businesses need to ensure however, that the products they sell are as well represented in the digital world, as they are in the physical world. </p>
									<p>As a result, GS1 is partnering with the retail industry in order to build a strong data foundation, based on unique product identity. This will enable a steady, reliable flow of information, and transparency in operations between retailers and brand owners. </p>
									<p>The Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN) allows retailers, access to a database that contains and catalogues every single information required about their products that can be shared and updated amongst trading partners to be shared with one another, or even to their customers. Said information is reliable, accurate and up-to-date for everyone involved. </p>
									<p>GS1 continues and will continue to guide retail industries in response to these respective changes and challenges in a joint effort to strengthen the globally-accepted standards that GS1 and its corresponding sectors and industries have come to use and rely upon. </p>
